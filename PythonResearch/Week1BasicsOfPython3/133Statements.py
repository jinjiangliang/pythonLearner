Compound Statements
indentation: 
    use a tab, stick to it;
header line:
if x>y:
    difference = x-y
    print("x")
//
in Python,
if test:
    [block of code]
elif y>x:
    absval = y-x
else:
    absval = 0

Consider the following code:

if False: 
    print("False!") 
elif True: 
    print("Now True!") 
else: 
    print("Finally True!") 
What does this print?
"Now True!"

Consider the following code:

if n%2 == 0:
  #blank#
else:
  print("odd")

Assume that n is a previously defined integer. Can you replace the #blank# line so that the code prints "even" if n is even, and "odd" if n is odd?

print("even")
