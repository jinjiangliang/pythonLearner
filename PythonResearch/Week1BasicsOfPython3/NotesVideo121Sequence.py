index starts at 0;
ending at -1;
//
slicing
s[2]
s[0:2]
starts at 0, with 2 elements, that is 0,1
//
Consider the following tuple and index (1,2,3)[-0] . What will this return?
Counting from index 0, this moves backwards 0 steps, which is still index 0. 
For this tuple, this returns value 1.

Consider the following tuple and index (1,2,3)[-0:0] . What will this return?
